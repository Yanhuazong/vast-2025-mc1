    <div class="question">
      1. Design and develop visualizations and visual analytic tools that will
      allow Silas to explore and understand the profile of Sailor Shift's
      career.
    </div>

    <div class="sub-question">

    <p>
      We designed and developed Melody Way, an interactive tool that let you
      explore how artists and genres connect and evolve, as shown in Figure 1.
      In its radial "galaxy," each artist's angle marks their latest release
      year and their distance shows influence, hover for quick stats. A
      surrounding timeline arc plots songs and albums by genre, with clicks
      revealing linked artists and labels below. Filters, search, and a built-in
      AI chatbot help you zoom to any role, genre, or influence path, while
      selecting an artist highlights collaborators and shows who inspired and
      was inspired by them.
    </p>

    <ol type="a">
      <li class="answer">
        Figure 2 charts Sailor Shift's full career, while the close-up in Figure
        3 isolates her incoming influence links (dashed lines). No single artist
        or work dominates those links: across 1983-2030, every influence appears
        only once. The sources span genres including
        <span class="genre indie-folk">Indie Folk</span>,
        <span class="genre dream-pop">Dream Pop</span>,
        <span class="genre synthwave">Synthwave</span>, and arrive via stylistic
        echoes (Sty), melodic interpolations (In), covers (Cov), lyrical
        references (Ly), and direct sampling (Sam). Taken together, the pattern
        shows Sailor drawing inspiration from a rotating cast of songs and
        albums, evolving through diversity rather than through allegiance to any
        one mentor or era.
      </li>
      <li class="answer">
        Figure 4 shows that Sailor Shift worked with dozens of collaborators
        including lyricists, composers, and performers such as Maya Jensen,
        Jonak Calloway, and Beatrice Albright. She released her music through
        labels like Coastal Harmony Studios, Vertical Ascent Records, and
        Oceanic Records. Although the schema defines influence links as
        work-to-work, every recorded influence from Sailor is artist-to-artist.
        As Figure 5 illustrates, she inspired groups such as Copper Canyon
        Ghosts and The Phantom Operators, as well as solo artists like Caisian
        Storm, underscoring the breadth and enduring impact of her creative
        reach.
      </li>
      <li class="answer">
        As shown in Figures 4 and 5, Sailor Shift, as both performer and
        lyricist, has influence radiating across the Oceanus Folk scene. She
        wrote lyrics for eight genre-defining albums, including Electric
        Reverie, Ballads for the Low Tide, and Artificial Sunset, work that
        peers later echoed. Her impact is most evident in Copper Canyon Ghosts,
        who directly sampled her vocals before releasing a string of notable
        Oceanus Folk recordings such as albums like Tide-Worn Tales and singles
        like Shadow in Smuggler's Cove, among others. Together, these links
        underscore Sailor's dual role as prolific contributor and catalyst for
        subsequent Oceanus Folk artists.

    </div>
    <p>
      Using the filters in Melody Way, we can explore how the influence of
      Oceanus Folk has spread across the musical world.
    </p>
    <ol type="a">
      <li class="answer">
        With Oceanus Folk selected as the influencing genre, we see all the
        artworks shaped by it, along with their contributing artists and
        associated record labels (Fig. 6). The line chart above the timeline
        reveals that Oceanus Folk's influence has not followed a smooth,
        continuous rise. Instead, it shows intermittent surges, with notable
        peaks in years like 2017 followed by quieter periods, such as the lull
        between 2017 and 2021.
      </li>
      <li class="answer">
        Figure 7 displays only the artworks from other genres that were
        influenced by Oceanus Folk, along with their contributors and associated
        record labels. Genres such as
        <span class="genre indie-folk">Indie Folk</span>,
        <span class="genre dream-pop">Dream Pop</span>, and
        <span class="genre desert-rock">Desert Rock</span>
        show strong influence from Oceanus Folk. Since artists are positioned
        based on their overall influence and productivity with the most
        prominent artists appearing farther from the center, we can easily
        identify top artists, as marked by a white circle. Figure 8 shows
        detailed views of three specific artists selected from within this
        circle: Xiuying Yao (3 of 9 works), Min Fu (2 of 10), and Filippo Pelli
        (2 of 11), all of whom have multiple works influenced by Oceanus Folk.
      </li>
<li class="answer">
  Figure 9 highlights how the influences on Oceanus Folk shifted over
  time: yearly influence pie charts turn from mostly yellow
  (self‑influence) to larger pink and green slices, indicating growing
  inputs from Rock sub‑genres such as
  <span class="genre space-rock">Space Rock</span> and
  <span class="genre blues-rock">Blues Rock</span>, along with genres like
  <span class="genre americana">Americana</span> and
  <span class="genre synthwave">Synthwave</span>. Figure 10 quantifies
  this shift, showing the number of Oceanus Folk artworks influenced by
  the Folk genre and Rock genre families over time. While
  Rock influence continues to grow, Folk influence diminishes sharply
  after 2028 and nearly disappears by 2035, indicating a clear transition
  in Oceanus Folk's stylistic roots. Figure 11 reinforces this trend: the
  theme river chart shows the Oceanus Folk stream widening dramatically
  after 2028, visually emphasizing its rise and the genre migration
  fueling it. The growing presence of red circles within the Oceanus Folk band after 2028
  represents artists arriving from Rock genres, signaling increasing cross-genre migration from rock into Oceanus Folk.

    </div>
    <p>
      To define what it means to be a rising star in the music industry, we
      analyzed the careers of three artists with varying paths to recognition,
      using Melody Way's influence and collaboration data.
    </p>
    <ol type="a">
      <li class="answer">
        We visualized the careers of Jay Walters, Kimberly Snyder, and Crimson
        Carriage to explore different rising patterns, as shown in Figure 12.
        Jay Walters has had a long, steady career since the 1980s, contributing
        as performer, lyricist, composer, and producer. His influential works
        like Wilderness Vows at Twilight and Unfinished Conversations show
        widespread impact. Kimberly Snyder's shorter career includes consistent
        output and strong collaboration, with multiple works influencing others.
        Crimson Carriage is a new group with steady contributions, notable
        collaborations like Sailor Shift, and support from major labels. These
        cases reflect diverse success paths: long-term presence, rapid
        influence, and emerging potential, each tied to consistent output,
        collaboration, and creative roles.
      </li>
      <li class="answer">
        To predict the next Oceanus Folk stars, we looked for artists who (1)
        stay active post‑2035, (2) show expanding collaboration networks, (3)
        take on creative roles (e.g., performer), (4) work with established
        Oceanus‑focused labels, and (5) display rising influence, though the
        last metric might be under‑recorded because the possible gaps in the
        dataset. Using Melody Way's chatbot and graph checks, we identify
        The Brine Choir, Copper Canyon Ghost, and Maya Jensen as the strongest
        candidates. As shown in Figure 13, each is active in or after 2035, has
        collaborated with influential stars like Sailor Shift, released notable
        Oceanus‑Folk works, and maintains partnerships with major labels.

    <h3>Reflection Questions</h3>

    <div class="question">
      1. This challenge pushed you to develop new techniques for visual
      representation?
    </div>
    <p>
      Yes. The graph's scale led us to a three-layer design. We group nodes into
      artists, artworks, and labels and reveal links only on hover, eliminating
      hair-ball clutter. Artist nodes form a radial "galaxy": distance from the
      center encodes combined influence and productivity, angle marks the year
      of the latest release, and a slender tail extends backward to show how
      that influence has grown over time. Beneath the galaxy, a curved timeline
      pins each artwork to its release year and supports range filtering. The
      result lets users see who connects to whom, how strongly, and when without
      overload.
    </p>

    <div class="question">
      2. Did you participate in last year's challenge? If so, did your
      experience last year help prepare you for this year's challenge?
    </div>
    <p>
      Some of our team members participated in last year's challenge. That
      experience helped us become more familiar with the overall process,
      including understanding the dataset structure, identifying storylines, and
      managing the timeline. It also gave us a clearer sense of what makes a
      compelling and informative visualization, which allowed us to plan and
      iterate more effectively this year.
    </p>

    <div class="question">
      3. What was the most difficult part of working on this year's data and
      what could have made it more accessible?
    </div>
    <p>
      The most difficult part was the incompleteness of the dataset, especially
      for the years after 2030, where the number of artworks drops
      significantly. Additionally, many artwork-to-artwork influence links were
      missing for key artists like Sailor, making it difficult to trace her
      indirect influence. A more complete dataset with consistent records across
      all years and more comprehensive influence relationships would have made
      the analysis more accessible and accurate.
